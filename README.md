Apply new knowledge and skills in Angular, with different techniques and libraries

## Components

- A chart used to show data and the possibility to send infos about it with a Telegram BOT, used Chart Js and a random data generator script;

### Mqtt

### Drag And Drop
- Just an example how to work with drag and drop with NG2-Dragula;

### Mockups
- Here I develop and test new shared components and try to apply different techniques and skills;
